# Descriptuon

My cousin is into the card game Star Realms.  The game has a few things that require tracking on each player's turn so I built him a tracker so he can track Authority (aka Hitpoints), Trade (aka Gold), and Combat (aka Attack)

## Technical Notes

### Screen Responsiveness

The site is designed responsively with the knowledge that mostly this will be seen/used on a mobile device.  The base resizing is done as a modifier depending on how much the user deviates from a 1200 x 800 screen.  

## Dependencies

 - react
 - react-router
 - react-router-dom
 - sass

 ## Future Features

 - Add images for Trade, Combat, etc.
 - Add a backend for tracking of user statistics (wins, losses, etc.)
 - Add screen transitions using framer motion (dependency installed but not used at the moment)
